# Essay 1: (History of) Western Ethics

> Prompt:  You're on transatlantic cruise with a friend, when your ship hits an iceberg. It starts to go down, and everyone on the ship evacuates to the lifeboats. Upon landing in the water, you notice that your lifeboat, which you share with 9 others, has a serious leak. You're hours away from rescue, but you figure that with all ten people bailing, you might make it. After about an hour, you notice another lifeboat nearby, which has your friend in it. It has an empty seat, and they're waiving you over. If you leave for the other boat, you'll likely get rescued, but the damaged lifeboat will soon sink, likely killing everyone on board. If you stay, the damaged lifeboat will be able to stay afloat for several more hours, making rescue more likely, but by no means definite. The rescue boats are starting to drift apart, so this is our only chance to, as it were, jump ship.

Is it moral to abandon another person's chance of survival, were doing such to guarantee your own? "In order to figure out whether this is a moral rule, we need to know whether it can be a universal rule." (Kant "The Role of Happiness in Ethics", 5) One cannot will that everyone in a leaking lifeboat should doom the others to seek their place on a better lifeboat, because if everyone in said lifeboat were to jump out and attempt to gain access to the other they would be guaranteeing the demise of the other nine. Moreover, in the struggle over the single seat, it is entirely possible that all would perish in the waves, or that the good lifeboat could be overturned or damaged, leading to deaths from the other lifeboat as well. You cannot make a moral exception just for yourself, if you do it ceases to be moral in Deontological Ethics.

Conversely, the case is not so clear cut when viewed through the lens of Utilitarianism. According to Mill "the
ultimate end. . . ., for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of other people) is an existence as free as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments." (Mill "The Role of Happiness in Ethics", 16) Within Utilitarianism, whether something is moral is determined by whether it reduces pain and increases pleasure, or vice versa. 

In the given lifeboat scenario, there are four main potential outcomes. Should you stay and the lifeboat sink, it would not have been a moral decision, as it cost your life while retaining no benefit. Should you stay, and the lifeboat be rescued, it was a moral decision that saved nine lives. Should you leave, the lifeboat will sink. Given this, if your staying would have led to the people on board being rescued, then your decision to leave was immoral, costing nine lives. Conversely, if they would not have been rescued regardless of what you did, leaving was the correct decision, saving one life.

This question provides an interesting contrast between the motivation based morality of Kant, and the results based morality of Mill. Deontology, by virtue of ignoring circumstance, can greatly simplify the question of what is moral, whereas within Utilitarianism, there will always be external influences to consider, and a conclusive answer can be quite difficult to find.
